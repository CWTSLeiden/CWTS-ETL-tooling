1.0.0.7 - 20210510

New parameter:

	Remove_original_files

	If true the original files are deleted instead of renamed to .split. Default is false.

1.0.0.6 - 20210420

New parameters:

	Include_xml_prolog

	Include_xml_prolog is used for Scopus data because ReadData merges the publication XML file with a citedby.xml. If citedby.xml contains
	the XML prolog, ReadData will render an empty file. So use false for Scopus data.

Removing HTML from tags is changed. HtmlDecode is no longer used.

1.0.0.5 - 20210414

New parameters:

	XmlFolder
	FindFilesRecursive

	The program can now process more than one files. The files have to be in the XmlFolder. Only files with .xml extension are processed.
	If findfilerecursive is true the files with extension .xml in all subfolders will be processed. If false only files with .xml extension
	in the given folder are processed.

	The parameter splittag can now be empty or omitted. In that case the file will only be cleaned and not splitted. This is first introduced
	for the Scopus datasource.

1.0.0.4 - 20210315

XML tags with mixed content can be reordered so that ReadData handles it correct.
For Crossref data the namespaces starting with ns (e.g. ns4:) can be replaced with the correct namespace.
See readme.txt for the use of the parameter fix_crossref_namespaces

1.0.0.3 - 20210201

Cleansing of the data (this documentation is also added to the readme.txt)

From                To
/t (tab)            space
&#13; (linefeed)    space

All lines are trimmed.

1.0.0.2 - 20210120

Added new parameter remove_namespaces.

If remove_namespaces=true the namespaces will be removed from the resulting XML.

If the parameter is not used or has a different value then true the namespaces will
not be removed.

1.0.0.1 - 20210120

Namespaces are removed from tags (xmlns="xxx")
